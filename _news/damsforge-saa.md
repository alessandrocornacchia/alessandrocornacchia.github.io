I gave two talks at **ACM SOSP** co-located events: I presented [DMAS-Forge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11872) at the [1st Workshop on Systems for Agentic AI](https://saa2025.github.io), and "Between Promise and Pain: The Reality of Automating Failure Analysis in Microservices with LLMs" at [ACM APSys 2025](https://apsys.acm.org/2025/).
