I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/), member of [SANDS Lab](https://sands.kaust.edu.sa/) led by [Prof. Marco Canini](https://mcanini.github.io/).

My research interests span computer networks and distributed systems, with a focus on **network observability** and the application of **agentic AI** to networked systems. I am currently exploring how Large Language Models can empower network operators to diagnose failures more effectively. My previous work has focused on designing systems that harness programmable network hardware to achieve real-time, cost-efficient observability.

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical, Electronics and Communications Engineering from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/) (Italy) in 2024, where I was advised by [Prof. Paolo Giaccone](https://www.telematica.polito.it/member/paolo-giaccone/) and [Prof. Andrea Bianco](https://www.telematica.polito.it/member/andrea-bianco/). I hold a M.S. in Communications and Computer Networks Engineering (2020) from Politecnico di Torino and a B.Eng. in Computer Engineering (2017) from [Università di Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/).
